# Revenue Forecasting ML Pipeline

A production-ready machine learning pipeline for subscription business revenue forecasting, featuring automated customer segmentation, MRR analytics, and adaptive model selection.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system transforms raw subscription data into actionable revenue forecasts using intelligent customer segmentation and performance-tier analysis. Built with scikit-learn and pandas, it provides 12-month to 5-year MRR projections through automated data pipelines and adaptive ML models.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Intelligent Customer Segmentation**
- **Performance-Based Tiers**: Automatically segments customers into high, moderate, and underperformers based on revenue contribution
- **Dynamic Segmentation**: Replaces traditional demographic groupings with data-driven performance metrics
- **Revenue Impact Analysis**: Identifies high-performers contributing 4.5x more revenue than low-performers

### **Intelligent ML Forecasting Engine**
- **Auto-Selection System**: Intelligently chooses between Linear and Polynomial Lasso regression models based on performance tier characteristics and dataset complexity
- **Adaptive Algorithm Logic**: Full dataset gets user choice between Ending MRR (Linear) and Net New MRR (Polynomial) models, while performance tiers auto-select optimal approaches
- **Multi-Horizon Forecasting**: Supports flexible 12-month to 5-year revenue projections with configurable time windows
- **Robust Model Validation**: Comprehensive performance assessment with MAE, RMSE, R¬≤, and cross-validation scoring

### **Automated Data Pipeline**
- **ETL Processing**: Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading using pandas
- **Price Change Integration**: Handles dynamic pricing scenarios and mid-contract adjustments
- **27 Revenue Metrics**: Comprehensive MRR calculations including take rate, expansion, contraction, and churn
- **Real-time Processing**: Filters and calculates metrics across performance tiers automatically

### **Intelligent Model Selection**
The system features an adaptive model selection engine that automatically chooses the optimal forecasting approach:

| Performance Tier | Selection Logic | Model Options | Features | Use Case |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Full Dataset** | User Choice | Linear (Ending MRR) / Polynomial (Net New MRR) | 6-11 | Strategic planning flexibility |
| **High Performers** | Auto-Select | Linear (Ending MRR) | 6 | Stable high-value forecasts |
| **Moderate/Under** | Auto-Select | Linear (Ending MRR) | 6 | Consistent tier projections |

```python
# Intelligent model selection in action
def auto_select_performance_tier_model(csv_file_path, months_to_project=12):
    performance_tier = Path(csv_file_path).parts[-3]
    
    if performance_tier == 'Full':
        # Interactive model selection for comprehensive analysis
        choice = prompt_user_model_selection()
        return ending_mrr_model() if choice == "Linear" else net_new_mrr_model()
    else:
        # Auto-select optimal model for performance tiers
        return ending_mrr_model(csv_file_path, months_to_project)
```

- **Resource Allocation**: Identified high-value segments for marketing focus
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Reduced prediction errors through adaptive model selection
- **Strategic Planning**: Enabled data-driven 5-year revenue projections

### **Key Metrics Calculated**
```python
# Sample of 27 automated metrics
metrics = [
    'Starting MRR', 'New MRR', 'Expansion', 'Contraction', 'Churn',
    'Net New MRR', 'Ending MRR', 'ARPU', 'Take Rate',
    'Customer Base Growth', 'Site Openings', 'Revenue Growth Rate'
]
```

## üö¶ Quick Start

### **Installation**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pathlib
```

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from main_pipeline import main_pipeline, batch_run_pipeline

# Single performance tier analysis
main_pipeline(performance_tier='high_performers')

# Batch processing all tiers
batch_run_pipeline(selected_keys=[0, 1, 2, 3])  # Full, High, Moderate, Under
```

### **Intelligent Forecasting**
```python
from models.auto_select import auto_select_performance_tier_model

# Adaptive model selection with user choice for Full dataset
results = auto_select_performance_tier_model(
    csv_file_path='output/Full/combined_results/baseline_combined_mrr_arpu_results.csv',
    months_to_project=12
)

# For Full dataset, system prompts:
# 1. Ending MRR (Linear Model) - Strategic stability
# 2. Net New MRR (Polynomial Model) - Growth pattern analysis

print(f"Model Selected: {results['model_type']}")
print(f"Projected ARR: ${results['projected_arr']:,.2f}")
print(f"Growth Rate: {results['growth_rate']:.1f}%")
```
